# Hi! I'm Kathryn

This is my website. It's a work in progress. :)


## About me

I am a software developer based in Victoria, BC. My work experience so far has been primarily native Android development and React/TypeScript. Right now, I am practicing frontend web development (by making this portfolio site!) and learning a bit about AI on the side.

## About the site

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so if you want to pull and try running it locally (for whatever reason) you can do so using `npm start` and it will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

It is deployed using heroku at [https://thryn-gabriel.herokuapp.com/](https://thryn-gabriel.herokuapp.com/).
